# Future Sam Read me:

# Bug:
1.
Given an entity is using sliding movement
when the entity reaches the end of a map,
Then it slides across the entire map

It should instead land gently at the next tile on the next map.

# Feature: Saving and loading maps to disk
I should be able to save maps to disk somehow. Perhaps a database?
